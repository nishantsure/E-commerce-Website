I implemented Spring Security 6 with JWT (access + refresh tokens), method-level RBAC, and CSRF protection.
The architecture is fully stateless, with token validation filters and refresh token renewal flow.
I’ve separated profiles for test and production, allowing seamless CI/CD integration.
My next step would be to implement OAuth2 Login and to add token blacklisting and rotation for even stronger session control.
